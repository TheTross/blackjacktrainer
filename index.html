    <p>
      This short guide was created after years of casual study—not as a path to “beat the house,” but to understand it. 
      Blackjack fascinated me because it’s one of the fairest casino games mathematically, yet most players still lose for reasons that have little to do with math. 
      <strong>The Blackjack Mindset</strong> breaks down those reasons in clear, practical language.

    <h3>What You’ll Learn</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Probability Without the Math Headache:</strong> An intuitive way to think about odds, variance, and why the “right” choice can still lose.</li>
      <li><strong>The Psychology of Decision Fatigue:</strong> How emotions sneak into logical play and change our behavior over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Common Pitfalls:</strong> The tiny judgment errors that add up to big losses—like “chasing” or overconfidence after a good run.</li>
      <li><strong>Why Betting Systems Fail:</strong> A simple explanation of why doubling or streak-chasing doesn’t overcome mathematical reality.</li>
      <li><strong>Inside the Casino Design:</strong> How the environment nudges players into riskier behavior, often without them noticing.</li>
      <li><strong>Responsible Entertainment:</strong> How to enjoy the game for what it is—a test of patience and decision-making—not a source of income.</li>

    <h3>Try the Decision Simulator</h3>
    <p>
      The guide includes a small, interactive simulator that lets you experience the real consequences of common player decisions—
      like hitting on a bad hand, raising when emotional, or adjusting bet sizes impulsively. 
      No money is ever involved; instead, the simulator provides instant feedback on how emotions and probabilities collide over time.
