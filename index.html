    <h1>The Blackjack Mindset</h1>
    <h2>Learn the logic behind every hand, not how to chase outcomes</h2>
  </header>

  <!-- Intro / Credibility -->
  <section id="intro">
    <p>
      This project started from a simple curiosity: why do people who know the rules of blackjack still make
      choices that increase their losses over time? Rather than promising shortcuts or secret systems,
      <strong>The Blackjack Mindset</strong> focuses on understanding decisions, probabilities, and the emotions
      that shape play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The homepage below includes an interactive hand trainer and links to short lessons that explain the
      underlying ideas: probability, psychology, common mistakes, and responsible play as entertainment.

  <!-- Interactive Trainer Overview -->

    <h3>Interactive Decision Trainer</h3>
    <p>
      The interactive trainer below presents a simple blackjack hand, asks what you would do, and then
      compares your choice with a basic strategy recommendation for that situation. This is not about
      “perfect play” or guarantees; it is about seeing how small edges and disciplined decisions look in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      After each hand, you will see:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your decision and the recommended action for that hand.</li>
      <li>A short explanation of <strong>why</strong> that recommendation exists (e.g., bust risk, dealer bust risk, long-run expectation).</li>
      <li>A running summary of how often you match the recommended strategy.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="trainer">
    <h3>Try a Hand</h3>
    <p>
      This v1 trainer is simplified to focus on core concepts. It uses a small set of common hands to illustrate
      why certain decisions are recommended over others. No real money is used, tracked, or implied.

  <!-- How the Trainer Works -->
  <section id="how-it-works">
    <h3>How the Trainer Teaches Strategy</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of memorizing a full chart, you learn through patterns. The trainer focuses on a few key ideas:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>When your total is high, the main risk is busting yourself.</li>
      <li>When the dealer shows a strong card, the risk is letting them outdraw you by standing too soon.</li>
      <li>Certain hands (like pairs of 8s or Aces) are structurally better when split, even if it feels uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>Doubling is recommended when the odds of improving are strong and the dealer is more likely to be in a weak position.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each explanation is written in plain language so you can connect the recommendation to an underlying reason,
      not just a rule.
    </p>

        player: "16 (10 + 6)",
        dealer: "10",
        recommended: "hit",
        explanation: "With 16 against a strong dealer 10, standing leaves you losing too often. Hitting may bust sometimes, but in the long run it loses less."
      },
      {
        player: "12 (10 + 2)",
        dealer: "4",
        recommended: "stand",
        explanation: "The dealer is more likely to bust with a 4. If you hit, you risk busting yourself on many cards. Standing keeps the dealer under pressure."
      },
      {
        player: "11 (5 + 6)",
        dealer: "6",
        recommended: "double",
        explanation: "With 11 against a weak dealer 6, you have many ways to improve to a strong total. Doubling increases your exposure when the odds are in your favour."
      },
      {
        player: "A,7 (soft 18)",
        dealer: "9",
        recommended: "hit",
        explanation: "Soft 18 against a 9 is not as strong as it looks. Hitting can improve your total, and the Ace protects you from busting immediately."
      },
      {
        player: "8,8 (pair of 8s)",
        dealer: "10",
        recommended: "split",
        explanation: "16 is a difficult total to play. Splitting 8s lets you start two new hands from a stronger starting point instead of playing one weak 16."
      },
      {
        player: "A,6 (soft 17)",
        dealer: "3",
        recommended: "double",
        explanation: "Soft 17 can improve on many cards without busting, and the dealer 3 is relatively weak. Doubling makes sense when you can press a good situation."
